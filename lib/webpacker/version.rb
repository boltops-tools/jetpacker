module Webpacker
  # Change the version in package.json too, please!
  # Since this fork and branch originally started from rails/webpacker
  # The git tags collide. As a hacky workaround adding 100 to the patch version.
  # Example:
  #  webpacker-jets 3.2.100 # added 100 to the patch version
  #  webpacker 3.2.0 # original
  VERSION = "3.2.100".freeze
end
